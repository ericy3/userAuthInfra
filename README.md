# Basic User Authentication Infrastructure

This is a basic user authentication infrastructure built using AWS's CDK.
The infrastructure for this project consists of API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and is written in Go.
Included is also simple middleware using JSON Web Token (JWT) to grant users access tokens to necessary data.
This project was more intended for learning Go and working with AWS's infrastructure as code principles but can be expanded upon for my future projects.
